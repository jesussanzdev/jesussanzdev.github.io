## About

Welcome to the personal website of **Jes√∫s Sanz**! This site is built using the **Zaggonaut theme**, a minimalist and versatile design that emphasizes simplicity and clean aesthetics. The core of the site is powered by **Astro**, a modern static site generator that optimizes performance and ensures a smooth browsing experience. 

What sets this website apart, however, is the personal touch behind it. Built with a little bit of imagination and a lot of passion, this site reflects my journey as a developer, sharing insights, projects, and experiences along the way. Whether you're here to explore my work, dive into my blog posts, or simply learn more about what I do, I hope you find something inspiring.

Feel free to browse through, and don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or ideas to share!
