## The Details

**Salvapatas** is a proof-of-concept (POC) web application focused on helping reunite lost pets with their owners. Developed with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**, the app provides a clean, user-friendly landing page where users can **search for missing pets** or **report animals they've found** in their area.

Its simple yet effective interface demonstrates how modern web technologies can be used to support local communities and animal welfare efforts.
