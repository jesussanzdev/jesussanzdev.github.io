In this article, I share insights from years of experience in building digital products, highlighting common challenges and offering practical advice for launching a successful product. Key takeaways include:

- **Understand Your Tech Stack**: Ensure your team has a strong grasp of the chosen technologies to avoid technical debt and facilitate scalability.

- **Limit External Dependencies**: Be selective with third-party libraries to minimize maintenance overhead and potential issues with unmaintained packages.

- **Modularize Your Application**: Plan for scalability by designing your application in modular components, allowing for easier updates and maintenance.

- **Plan for Internationalization**: If your product targets multiple regions, incorporate internationalization strategies early in the development process.
