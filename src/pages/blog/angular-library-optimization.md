Building and optimizing Angular libraries can be challenging due to limited documentation and real-world examples. This article provides practical guidance on enhancing your libraries' scalability and maintainability.

Key strategies include:

- **Effective Use of `peerDependencies`**: Ensuring that shared dependencies are properly declared to prevent version conflicts and duplication in consuming applications.

- **Designing Tree-Shakable Code**: Structuring your library so that unused code can be eliminated during the build process, reducing bundle size.

- **Optimizing Build Configurations**: Leveraging Angular's build tools to improve performance and maintainability.
